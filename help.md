## How to get versioning automated when using Git Flow?

To automate versioning when using Git Flow, you can use a tool like [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/). GitVersion is a .NET tool that automatically generates semantic version numbers for your Git repositories based on commit history, tags, and branching strategy.

### Integrating GitVersion with Jenkins for a bigger dev team

1. Install the [GitVersion Jenkins Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitversion-plugin/).

2. In your Jenkins pipeline script, add the `gitversion()` step to generate and store versioning information as environment variables:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Versioning') {
            steps {
                gitversion()
            }
        }
        // Your other build, test, and deploy stages
    }
}
```

3. Access the generated versioning information using environment variables provided by the GitVersion Jenkins Plugin. For example, use `${env.GitVersion_SemVer}` to access the semantic version number.

4. Use the versioning information in your build, test, and deployment processes as needed.

## Can GitHub Actions be used to run Groovy pipelines?

GitHub Actions does not have native support for running Groovy pipelines as Jenkins does. However, you can still use GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy Groovy-based applications by converting your Groovy pipeline into a GitHub Actions workflow file, which is written in YAML. This will involve converting each stage in your Groovy pipeline into a corresponding job in the GitHub Actions workflow file and setting up the necessary steps, actions, and environment to run the build, test, and deployment tasks.

## What happens in the method gitversion()?

In a Jenkins pipeline script, the `gitversion()` step is provided by the GitVersion Jenkins Plugin. When this step is executed, GitVersion analyzes the Git repository's commit history, tags, and branching structure to generate semantic versioning information. The generated versioning information is stored as environment variables that can be accessed in subsequent steps of the pipeline.

## Can I have a stateful machine with GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions doesn't provide a built-in stateful machine mechanism. However, you can create stateful behavior by using external services or artifacts to store and retrieve state information between workflow runs. Some popular options include Redis, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

## How to run a GitHub Action on a VM preinstalled with tools

1. Prepare your VM with the tools and software you need pre-installed.

2. Set up a self-hosted runner on your VM following the instructions in the GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners

3. Configure your GitHub Actions workflow to run on your self-hosted runner by setting the `runs-on` attribute to the appropriate label.

```yaml
jobs:
  your_job:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      # Your workflow steps
```
